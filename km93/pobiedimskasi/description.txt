sample_duration - the length of time that air passes through the monitoring device before it is analyzed (measured). So, it represents an averaging period in the atmosphere (for example, a 24-hour sample duration draws ambient air over a collection filter for 24 straight hours). For continuous monitors, it can represent an averaging time of many samples (for example, a 1-hour value may be the average of four one-minute samples collected during each quarter of the hour).
year - the year the annual summary data represents.
observation_percent - the percent representing the number of observations taken with respect to the number scheduled to be taken during the year. This is only calculated for monitors where measurements are required (e.g., only certain parameters).
state_name - the name of the state where the monitoring site is located.
